      <description>Motivation Hitting is complex with many schools of thought. As kids grow, I think it is imperative that we continue to re-evaluate which school of thought we teach kids that will in the long term benefit.
My recent searches for hitting drills led me to a video that discusses two different hitting approaches. After watching this video, I became convinced that there was a better way to teach kids how to properly hit.</description>

      <description>Motivation Our motto for infielders this year is &amp;ldquo;You play the ball &amp;hellip; don&#39;t let the ball play you.&amp;rdquo;
Fielding is really three fold: technique, footwork, and timing. The drills below are intended to address one of these areas. From a coaching perspective, we will need to introduce them in that order to be as efficient as possible and ensure skills are mastered before introducing new topics.
