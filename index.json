From a coaching perspective, we will need to introduce them in that order to be as efficient as possible and ensure skills are mastered before introducing new topics.\nHands Routine Overall Objective: TBD\nKnee Drill \nObjective:\n Work on good posture Soft hands Eyes on the ball Good transfers Consistently catching the ball on index finger  Setup:\n Partner up Start on your knees six inches away from outfield grass (forces you to get your hands out in front of you.)
