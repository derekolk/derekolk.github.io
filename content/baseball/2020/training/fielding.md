### Motivation
Our motto for infielders this year is "You play the ball ... don't let the ball play you."  

Fielding is really three fold: technique, footwork, and timing.  The drills below are intended to address one of these areas.  From a coaching perspective, we will need to introduce them in that order to be as efficient as possible and ensure skills are mastered before introducing new topics.
