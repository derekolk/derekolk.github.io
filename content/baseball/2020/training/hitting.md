### Motivation
Hitting is complex with many schools of thought.  As kids grow, I think it is imperative that we continue to re-evaluate which school of thought we teach kids that will in the long term benefit.

My recent searches for hitting drills led me to a video that discusses two different hitting approaches.  After watching this video, I became convinced that there was a better way to teach kids how to properly hit.
