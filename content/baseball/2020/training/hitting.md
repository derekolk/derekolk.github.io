### Motivation
Hitting is complex with many schools of thought.  As kids grow, I think it is imperative that we continue to re-evaluate which school of thought we teach kids that will in the long term benefit.

My recent searches for hitting drills led me to a video that discusses two different hitting approaches.  After watching this video, I became convinced that there was a better way to teach kids how to properly hit.

- Match the plane of the pitch
- Getting behind the ball
- Learn how to coil around your back leg

- Get into palm up position

**Setup:**
- Hold PVC pipe in the middle about a foot from the bottom.
- Point your feet towards the pitcher, coil over your back leg, and get up on your outside toe
- As the player starts the launch their body back, the PVC pipe will go back, getting the knob of the pipe working up
- The player will hit the bag and checkpoint their final position ... checking that the knob is up, palms up and down, player is behind the pipe, and pipe matched the plane  

**Callouts:**
- Created to give the player a feel of coiling and launching
- Tell the player to fall back

#### Tee Recoil
